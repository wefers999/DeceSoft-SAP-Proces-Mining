# Development Journal

## Project Overview
This journal tracks the development progress, decisions, and changes for the DeceSoft SAP Process Data Process Mining project.

## Project Rules
The following rules should be applied throughout the development process:

### Code Quality & Organization
- Keep the codebase clean and organized
- Avoid code duplication - check for existing similar functionality before implementing new features
- Refactor files when they exceed 200-300 lines of code
- Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- Write code that works across all environments (dev, test, prod)

### Development Practices
- Only make changes that are requested or well-understood
- When fixing issues, exhaust all options with existing implementation before introducing new patterns
- Remove old implementations when introducing new patterns to avoid duplicate logic
- Avoid writing one-off scripts in files
- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code affecting dev or prod environments
- Mocking data should only be used for tests, never for dev or prod

### Environment & Configuration
- Never overwrite .env files without explicit confirmation
- Maintain proper environment-specific configurations
- Follow security best practices for sensitive data

### Documentation
- Keep this development journal updated with significant changes and decisions
- Document technical decisions and their rationale
- Track bug fixes and solutions
- Maintain clear meeting notes and action items
